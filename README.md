Linear data structures
In linear data structures, the elements are arranged in sequence one after the other. Since elements are arranged in particular order, they are easy to implement.
However, when the complexity of the program increases, the linear data structures might not be the best choice because of operational complexities.

Popular linear data structures are:
  Array, 
  Queue,
  Stack, 
  LinkedList
